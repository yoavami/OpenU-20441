Introduction to Computer Science and Java

## Units

- [Unit 1](notes/unit-1)
- [Unit 2](notes/unit-2)
- [Unit 3](notes/unit-3)

## Objectives

The course serves as an introduction to Computer Science and programming. It deals with basic issues in Computer Science, problem solving, writing and analyzing algorithms, and programming principles. The programming paradigm is Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and the language used is Java.

In a single semester, this course includes all the material taught in Introduction to Computer Science Using Java I (20453) and Introduction to Computer Science Using Java II (20454). Students considering taking the course need to keep in mind that a large amount of material is covered, and in case of doubt, should contact an academic advisor in Computer Science.
