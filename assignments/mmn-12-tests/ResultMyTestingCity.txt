Start testing for your class City, good luck

1. Create new object by City class 
2. Testing functions get set 
3. Testing over functions

=====================================
1. Create a new object, c1 (cityName = "City-17", day = 30, month =  2, year = 1999, centerX = -7, centerY = -6, StationX = -3, StationY = -3,  numOfResidents = -127, numOfNeighborhoods = 0
for testing we creating a 2 new City, defaultResult = ("City-17", 1, 1, 2000, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1) and realCity = ("Insmut", 20, 3, 1925, 5, 7, 3, 6, 1500, 5)
Expected Result c1 == ("City-17", 01/01/2000, cityCenter = (0,0), centralStation = (0, 0), numOfResidents = 0, numOfNeighborhoods = 1)
c1 is  equals dafaultResult ? true

c1 is: 
City name: City-17
Date established: 01/01/2000
City center: (0,0)
Central station: (0,0)
Number of residents: 0
Number of neighborhoods: 1


defaultResult is: 
City name: City-17
Date established: 01/01/2000
City center: (0,0)
Central station: (0,0)
Number of residents: 0
Number of neighborhoods: 1


=====================================
now let's change c1 = new City(realCity)
c1 is  equals realCity ? true

c1 is: 
City name: Insmut
Date established: 20/03/1925
City center: (5,7)
Central station: (3,6)
Number of residents: 1500
Number of neighborhoods: 5


realCity is: 
City name: Insmut
Date established: 20/03/1925
City center: (5,7)
Central station: (3,6)
Number of residents: 1500
Number of neighborhoods: 5


now let's change c1 = new City(realCity)
=====================================
now let's change c1.setCityCenter(new Point(1,1)), c1.setDateEstablished(new Date(31, 12, 2017)), c1.setCentralStation(new Point(9, 9))
c1 is not equals realCity ? true

c1 is: 
City name: Insmut
Date established: 31/12/2017
City center: (1,1)
Central station: (9,9)
Number of residents: 1500
Number of neighborhoods: 5


realCity is: 
City name: Insmut
Date established: 20/03/1925
City center: (5,7)
Central station: (3,6)
Number of residents: 1500
Number of neighborhoods: 5


=====================================
c1 getCityName = Insmut
c1 getDateEstablished = 31/12/2017
c1 getCityCenter = (1,1)
c1 getCentralStation = (9,9)
c1 getNumOfResidents = 1500
c1 getNumOfNeighborhoods = 5
=====================================
now testing function addResidents, first we will add -2000 Residents, Expected Result returning = false and _numOfResidents == 0
c1.addResidents = false
and now c1 getNumOfResidents = 0
=====================================
new testing function addResidents, second we will add 2500 Residents, Expected Result returning = true and _numOfResidents == 2500
c1.addResidents = true
and now c1 getNumOfResidents = 2500
=====================================
now testing function moveCentralStation
now let's change c1.setCentralStation(new Point(3, 6))
right now we have c1 getCentralStation = (3,6)
now let's change c1.moveCentralStation(-7, 8), Expected Result nothing will change in the coordinates in c1
c1 getCentralStation = (3,6)
now let's change c1.moveCentralStation(-2, -5), Expected Result c1 getCentralStation = (1, 1)
c1 getCentralStation = (1,1)
=====================================
now testing function distanceBetweenCenterAndStation
now let's change c1.setCentralStation(new Point(4, 5))
c1 getCityCenter = (1,1)
c1 getCentralStation = (4,5)
Expected Result c1.distanceBetweenCenterAndStation() == 5.0
c1.distanceBetweenCenterAndStation() = 5.0 is it 5.0 ? true
=====================================
now testing function newCity
new City cNew = c1.newCity("Arkham", 10, 10)
c1 is not equals cNew ? true

c1 is: 
City name: Insmut
Date established: 31/12/2017
City center: (1,1)
Central station: (4,5)
Number of residents: 2500
Number of neighborhoods: 5


cNew is: 
City name: Arkham
Date established: 01/01/2018
City center: (11,11)
Central station: (14,15)
Number of residents: 0
Number of neighborhoods: 1


=====================================
now testing function cityEstablishedBetweenDates
now let's change c1.setDateEstablished(new Date(5, 5, 2017))
c1 getDateEstablished = 05/05/2017
Create a 3 new objects from Date, d1 = 1, 1, 2000, d2 = 3, 3, 2017, d3 = 20, 9, 2020
Expected Result c1.cityEstablishedBetweenDates(d1, d3) == true
c1 cityEstablishedBetweenDates d1 d3 ? true
Expected Result c1.cityEstablishedBetweenDates(c1.getDateEstablished(), d3) == true
c1 cityEstablishedBetweenDates c1.getDateEstablished() d3 ? true
Expected Result c1.cityEstablishedBetweenDates(d1, c1.getDateEstablished()) == true
c1 cityEstablishedBetweenDates d1 c1.getDateEstablished() ? true
Expected Result c1.cityEstablishedBetweenDates(d1, d2) == false
c1 cityEstablishedBetweenDates d1 d2 ? false
=====================================
now testing function establishmentDateDiff
now let's change c1.setDateEstablished(new Date(20, 3, 1926))
c1 getDateEstablished = 20/03/1926
realCity getDateEstablished = 20/03/1925
Expected Result c1.establishmentDateDiff(realCity) == 365
365 is 365 ? true
The end for testing your class City
